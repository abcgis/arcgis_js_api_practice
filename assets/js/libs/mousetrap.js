*    source, and configuration files. 
*  
*    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical 
*    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but 
*    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, 
*    and conversions to other media types. 
*  
*    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or 
*    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
*    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work 
*    (an example is provided in the Appendix below). 
*  
*    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
*    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
*    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
*    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes 
*    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
*    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, 
*    the Work and Derivative Works thereof. 
*  
*    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including 
*    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions 
*    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally 
*    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner 
*    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of 
*    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" 
*    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

*    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but 
*    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise 
*    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution." 
*  
*    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity 
*    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and 
*    subsequently incorporated within the Work. 
*  
* 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
*    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
*    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
*    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, 
*    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
*    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. 
*  
* 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
*    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
*    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
*    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, 
*    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, 
*    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable 
*    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
*    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) 
*    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You 
*    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
*    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work 
*    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
*    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
*    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate 
*    as of the date such litigation is filed. 
*  
* 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the 
*    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
*    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You 
*    meet the following conditions: 
*  
*    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
*        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and 
*  
*    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
*        stating that You changed the files; and 
*  
*    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works 
*        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
*        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
*        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of 
*        the Derivative Works; and 
*  
*    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
*        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must 
*        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
*        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not 
*        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one 
*        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed 
*        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
*        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
*        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
*        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
*        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
*        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
*        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
*        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
*        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
*        as modifying the License. 
*  
*    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
*    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions 
*    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or 
*    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
*    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
*    the conditions stated in this License. 
*  
* 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
*    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work 
*    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of 
*    this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
*    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify 
*    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed 
*    with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 
*  
* 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
*    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
*    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
*    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 
*  
* 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or 
*    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
*    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, 
*    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or 
*    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions 
*    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
*    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
*    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
*    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 
*  
* 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
*    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
*    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
*    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
*    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
*    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a 
*    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
*    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
*    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
*    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor 
*    has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
*  
* 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing 
*    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, 
*    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, 
*    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
*    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only 
*    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf 
*    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
*    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
*    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason 
*    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. 
*  
* END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
*  
* --- Exceptions to the Apache 2.0 License ---- 
*  
* As an exception, if, as a result of your compiling your source code, portions 
* of this Software are embedded into an Object form of such source code, you 
* may redistribute such embedded portions in such Object form without complying 
* with the conditions of Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(d) of the License. 
*  
* In addition, if you combine or link compiled forms of this Software with 
* software that is licensed under the GPLv2 ("Combined Software") and if a 
* court of competent jurisdiction determines that the patent provision (Section 
* 3), the indemnity provision (Section 9) or other Section of the License 
* conflicts with the conditions of the GPLv2, you may retroactively and 
* prospectively choose to deem waived or otherwise exclude such Section(s) of 
* the License, but only in their entirety and only with respect to the Combined 
* Software.
